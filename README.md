# Book-Movie Match (aka, the Other Match.com)

## Branch Convention

Our branches correspond to the issue that we're working on and the author of the branch. For example, for a branch written by Eileen that's addressing the issue of showing the movie results, the branch would be:

```md
eileen_feature-book-results
```

The author's name comes first, followed by an underscore, and then the feature with a short, descriptive phrase connected by hyphens.
